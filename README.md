# Unit 5 -Using Real-World Data pt.2
## Overview
In this lab, we will develop CryptoHustle Lite, a new web app that display a list of cryptocurrency prices sourced from the CryptoCompare API and allows for searching and filtering

## Required features
- [ ] User can view a list of at least 30 cryptocurrencies, including the image, name and price of the coin in US dollars
- [ ] User can search for a specific coin in the list of cryptocurrencies by symbol

## Stretch features:
- [ ] User can view a list of cryptocurrency scams on a separate pane in the page

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- [ ] Create an API key
- [ ] Read API documentation to understand how to make requests, either in GitHub docs or using the examples on the organizationâ€™s website
- [ ] Use the `useEffect()` hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions
- [ ] Fetch API data with async/await syntax
- [ ] Use props to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases
- [ ] Use conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, to display information on the page only when neccessary and return to a default state if not
- [ ] Additionally practice using CSS to format pages
